Inside the "Plugins" directory, you'll find all extensions I've created for PhoneGap.
Just download them, and put them in your "Plugins" group in your XCode project.

Then, download the relevant js file of the plugin you want to use (I've separated each js to each component I'm extending), and include it in your index.html file.
